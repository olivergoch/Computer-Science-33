-tar -zxvf openmplab.tgz
untarred the file
-make seq
compiled the files normally
-./seq
ran the normally compiled file
-make seq GPROF=1
made the file with GRPROF=1
-./seq
ran file normally, this produced gmon.out
-gprof seq | less
ran gprof to analyze file, func1 takes the most time
-vi func.c
inspected the functions, saw that there was the ability parallelize certain loops
used #pragma omp parrallel for on many of the for loops in func0, func1, and func2
however we cannot use that on all of these loops
some must have variables that must be locked with private (variable)
or for the accumulators, they must be protected with reduction(operation:variable)
